# MembersOnly

This is a project that I used to practice authentication using sessions. Logged in users can write messages to the message board and their name and date posted is hidden. Only members that know the secret passphrase can see who posted which messages and when.
Users who know the secret admin passphrase, can delete any message.

## Technology
Nodejs, express, sessions, MongoDB
